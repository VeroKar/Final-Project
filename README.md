# Final-Project
Final Project repository

The final project scenario that was chosen is to set up a web server and deploy a website online.

For this scenario, two possible solutions to chose from:

Solution 1:
Set up the web server on a Debian GNU/Linux distribution environment. All the files necessary for deploying the website (HTML, CSS, images, JavaScript file, etc.) will be saved in a remote repository on GitHub and in a local repository on the Debian machine. Changes to the files in the local machine will be pushed to the remote machine using the terminal and Git commands manually. The website files in GitHub will be hosted by a VPS to deploy a website.
OS: Debian
VPS: DigitalOcean
Web Server: Apache 2.0

Solution 2:
Directly manage the project website files via GitHub.com (don't use the terminal and Git commands). Use Linux Lite to save the project files and upload them to GitHub manually. Use OVH VPS client to host the website.
OS: Linux Lite
VPS: OVH
Web Server: nginx
